# TicTacToe
This project used the DE2-115 board and a 1920x1080 VGA monitor. 
It utilizes the 18 switches that are on the board to allow two players to play a 3x3 tic tac toe game against one another. 
Player 1 has switches 0 through 8 and player 2 has switches 9 through 17. 
The monitor shows if either player wins, by changing the background color to the color of the winner. 
The background does have to option to show if the game ends in a draw for some of the possible combinations that would lead to this.
